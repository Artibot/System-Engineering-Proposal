Industries are looking for effective and efficient working methods, which means that the industries are headed towards automation of services. This also includes the automobile industry that is looking for automation of vehicles and transportation. There are still many improvements that can be done, before the self-driving cars and vehicles can be used in the real environment. The objective to create a functional self-driving car seems to be closer than ever with the introduction of machine learning and increasing knowledge of AI.
\paragraph*{}
Our goal is to develop a working prototype of a self-driving RC car which uses different machine learning and AI techniques to train itself by using reinforcement learning in a controlled test environment. Furthermore, we will analyze the test results to look at the restrictions of the AI, and what define new methods to learn more effective and efficient self-driving methods. Today there are several experiments with real cars on commercial roads that already use these methods. 
We can conclude that our product may not be viable for the current market, but this projects main focus is for educational purposes and will be multidisciplinary study for students at USN.
