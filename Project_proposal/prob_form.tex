\section{Problem Description}

The American department of transportation; national highway traffic safety administration (NHTSA) encourages self driving vehicles.

Google worked developing autonomous self driving car, but still need approval for commercialization by the authorities, room for improvement.

Japan released self driving taxi.

Reduce crash causalities, damage, increase safety overall

The Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working to support the development of automated vehicle safety technologies because of their potential to save lives \cite{NHTSA231}


The objective is to create a feasible solution of an autonomous driving system which can be utilized by cars. The system will be developed in a lab environment where real life scenarios will be limited. Our priority is to focus on developing and optimizing the autonomous functionality of the car and not the car itself. Our goal is to design a safe and reliable autonomous system that can maneuver in a lane with obstacles.
