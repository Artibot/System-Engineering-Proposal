\section{Needs and opportunities} 

Today is the industry headed towards autonomy which also includes the automobile industry. Autonomy has played a huge role of automation of industrial processes by replacing humans with robots because of the effective and efficiency of machines . But for some industries like in the automobile industry, there are still many improvements which needs to be done, before robots are fully able to take over for the humans. Introduction of machine learning and AI have played some major role to be able to reach this goal, but since itâ€™s a very new technology there is little knowledge about it. 

Our goal is to develop a working prototype of a self- driving RC car which uses different machine learning and AI techniques to train itself by using reinforcement learning in a controlled test environment. And further analyze the test results to see the restrictions of the AI and what can further be improved to make the car to learn more effective and efficient. Today there are several experiments with real cars on commercial roads who already use this methods. 
We can conclude with that the current marked need may not be viable, but this project main focus is the educational purpose and will be multi-disciplinary study for students at USN.
